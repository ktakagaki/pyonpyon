### K. Takagaki (started Jun. 2014)
Behavioral scripts used at AG NRO, Abt. SPL, Leibniz Institut


## Goals
This project provides the following:
1. runs the two way GO/NOGO shuttlebox
2. parses resulting behavioral scripts

## Components:
1. Original behavioral scripts (directories `./GS` and `./LV`):
	- Generate and run experiment/play sound (`./LV`) ... programmed in Labview
	- Run behavioral trials based on triggers generated by the above (`./GS`)... programmed for the Colbourn "GraphicState4" system
2. New version 2 behavioral scripts  
	- run everything from Labview (`./LV2`)
	  (this was programmed to resolve fundamental unresolvable timing loop errors in the GraphicState system.
3. Parsing scripts for behavioral logs (`./pyonpyonw`)... written in Mathematica (Wolfram Language)
